# Note Taking App

This is a simple and clean Note Taking Android Application built using Java and Room Database.

The app allows users to easily create and delete notes. When no notes are available, the app displays a user-friendly message "No Notes - Create a Note". The notes are displayed in a list using CardView layout, and a FloatingActionButton is provided for quickly adding new notes.
